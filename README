Hi, and welcome to the ACGA website backend.

The site is broadly arranged into two sections: ACGA-relevant material, and CGL-relevant material. The corresponding urls/views/models are under their respective apps. The templates folder is correspondingly partitioned.

Some general django tips: changes to models/urls/settings are not dynamically loaded; you can force them to show up by restarting the server (>>>apachectl restart).
Models can be syntax-checked by running ./manage.py validate

Git repository is hosted at github.com/brilee/ACGA-website

There are some new commands under ./manage.py for your convenience, stored at /CGL/management/commands:

This recalculates match results, school records, and player records for the current season, from scratch. It's computationally intensive. It used to be run upon any update to a match, but that was way too slow. Now I run it once every two weeks, after I've finished adding that round's games.
./manage.py update_scores <Season Name>

(Needs to be adapted for use under manage.py) - This generates round pairings for the rest of the season, assuming that the season has had all of its round dates specified and all of its participating schools specified.
./manage.py round_pairings

This changes the current season, which will cause the entire site to update (recent/upcoming matches sidebar, results page, and a few other miscellaneous places). The setting is stores under /CGL/settings.py
./manage.py change_season <Season Name>
