Hi, and welcome to the ACGA website backend.

The site is broadly arranged into two sections: ACGA-relevant material, and CGL-relevant material. The corresponding urls/views/models are under their respective apps. The templates folder is correspondingly partitioned.

Some general django tips: changes to models/urls/settings are not dynamically loaded; you can force them to show up by restarting the server (>>>apachectl restart).
Models can be syntax-checked by running ./manage.py validate

Git repository is hosted at github.com/brilee/ACGA-website

There are some new commands under ./manage.py for your convenience, stored at /CGL/management/commands:

This recalculates match results, school records, and player records for the current season, from scratch. It's computationally intensive. It used to be run upon any update to a match, but that was way too slow. Now I run it once every two weeks, after I've finished adding that round's games.
./manage.py update_scores <Season Name>

This generates round pairings for the next round, as determined by date. This must be done incrementally every two weeks instead of at the beginning of the season, as new schools may have signed up in the meantime.
If the round already has some matches created, this algorithm ignores those schools and continues on. This is useful if you want to ensure that two schools are matched in an upcoming round.
./manage.py round_pairings

This changes the current season, which will cause the entire site to update (recent/upcoming matches sidebar, results page, and a few other miscellaneous places). This command is equivalent to editing the file located at /CGL/settings.py
./manage.py change_season <Season Name>

These two commands generate, and then send an email to currently participating schools, from the specified template. You can edit the rendered email before sending it out.
./manage.py render_email
./manage.py send_email

Available templates are:
/templates/next-round-announce
/templates/previous-round-results
