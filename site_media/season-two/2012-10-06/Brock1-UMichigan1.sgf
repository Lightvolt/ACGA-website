;W[na]WL[428.43]C[UMichigan1 [-\]: Good game.
yizao [3d?\]: yea
UMichigan1 [-\]: Losing the upper right group was too much.
yizao [3d?\]: Bob, right?
UMichigan1 [-\]: Yes. Hi Yizao.
Brock4 [-\]: great job
yizao [3d?\]: the left bottom, b seems a little too aggressive?
yizao [3d?\]: could have gone lighter?
UMichigan1 [-\]: Yes.
UMichigan1 [-\]: Too greedy.
Brock1 [-\]: good game
yizao [3d?\]: before that the game was very close
UMichigan1 [-\]: But I was not sure how else to play.
yizao [3d?\]: I would simply run away... :)))
UMichigan1 [-\]: I thought the thickness with the two stone capture might keep the game playable.
Brock1 [-\]: actually, that two is not meaningful
yizao [3d?\]: yea, playable, but I am afread already b lost some points there
yizao [3d?\]: c8 was a little greedy?
Brock1 [-\]: maybe
Brock1 [-\]: I want to balance
Brock1 [-\]: both sides
UMichigan1 [-\]: Yes, maybe with the weak stones in the middle.
yizao [3d?\]: w's attack was very successful
UMichigan1 [-\]: Yes.
UMichigan1 [-\]: Thanks for the game.
Brock1 [-\]: my mouse is broken, I accidently put h8 instead of f8
Brock1 [-\]: Thanks, too
yizao [3d?\]: good game
UMichigan1 [-\]: Good to see you Yizao.
yizao [3d?\]: you too!
Brock1 [-\]: BYe
UMichigan1 [-\]: How are things going.
UMichigan1 [-\]: Bye.
yizao [3d?\]: Hopefully I will Ann Arbor some time  
yizao [3d?\]: bye
yizao [3d?\]: not bad
UMichigan1 [-\]: I will look forward to seeing you then.
yizao [3d?\]: students are not as good as at UM, of course
yizao [3d?\]: otherwise the research environment is better (for me)
UMichigan1 [-\]: We have some excellent students.
yizao [3d?\]: yea
UMichigan1 [-\]: Good.
yizao [3d?\]: well, I mean undergrads
yizao [3d?\]: but the probabilists here are good and very nice
UMichigan1 [-\]: Great.
yizao [3d?\]: and some analysts are also very fun to talk to
UMichigan1 [-\]: I wish we had a bit more here.
yizao [3d?\]: so I saw another post of stat and math at UM?
yizao [3d?\]: hehe
UMichigan1 [-\]: Hmm. I am not sure about the post.
yizao [3d?\]: I mean, opening position?
yizao [3d?\]: OK
UMichigan1 [-\]: Working with math was a challenge.
yizao [3d?\]: then probably they just mention Stat in the post
UMichigan1 [-\]: I suppose we still have the position.
yizao [3d?\]: yea, I heard some ot it
yizao [3d?\]: so stats is hiring again?
UMichigan1 [-\]: I am not sure.
UMichigan1 [-\]: We have been thinking mainly about our external review.
yizao [3d?\]: I see
UMichigan1 [-\]: I think we may have a position.
yizao [3d?\]: Tailen talked about it last time
yizao [3d?\]: wow
UMichigan1 [-\]: Seems like we usually do.
UMichigan1 [-\]: Are there go players near you?
yizao [3d?\]: yes, very impressive
yizao [3d?\]: not until very recently I found a grad student playing
yizao [3d?\]: but we haven't played yet
yizao [3d?\]: I didn't check the club here
yizao [3d?\]: too busy schedule
UMichigan1 [-\]: Yes, I imagine you are busy.
yizao [3d?\]: but it would be fun to play Go in my office :-)))
UMichigan1 [-\]: What are you teaching?
yizao [3d?\]: calc I
yizao [3d?\]: teaching is easy
UMichigan1 [-\]: Good.
yizao [3d?\]: but there are some other issues
yizao [3d?\]: you understand:P
UMichigan1 [-\]: Anyway, I should run. We want to take advantage of the reasonable weather, going for a walk.
UMichigan1 [-\]: Teaching can be more than just teaching.
yizao [3d?\]: sure
yizao [3d?\]: have a nice weekend
yizao [3d?\]: Hopefully I will see you soon in AA
UMichigan1 [-\]: Thanks.  You too. And good luck with everything.
UMichigan1 [-\]: Sounds good.
UMichigan1 [-\]: Bye.
