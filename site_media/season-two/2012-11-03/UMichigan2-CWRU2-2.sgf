CWRU2 [2d?\]: Thanks for the game, it was a good fighting one
UMichigan2 [-\]: I was a bit worried I let my side group get too weak.
UMichigan2 [-\]: Yes, lots of fighting.
CWRU2 [2d?\]: yeah, I was thinking I Should've descended  instead of going after the top left group
UMichigan2 [-\]: Is there still an active club in Cleveland?
CWRU2 [2d?\]: yep, a few in fact
CWRU2 [2d?\]: although it's kinda the same people going around the place
CWRU2 [2d?\]: we have our CWRU club, a cleveland club and then a nearby college one too
UMichigan2 [-\]: I used to come down now and then for tournaments.
CWRU2 [2d?\]: we were actually talking about how we should do something with you guys sometime
CWRU2 [2d?\]: oh yeah?
CWRU2 [2d?\]: It's about 2 hours away?
UMichigan2 [-\]: Is Harold Boyd (sp?) still around?
CWRU2 [2d?\]: hmm, not that I know of
CWRU2 [2d?\]: was he in the cleveland club or the case one?
UMichigan2 [-\]: Or Roger White. Cleveland Club.
CWRU2 [2d?\]: I don't know too many people at the cleveland club, but...
UMichigan2 [-\]: It has probably been 10 or 15 years.
CWRU2 [2d?\]: there's a Dan, Michael and Paul
CWRU2 [2d?\]: that are somewhat regular
UMichigan2 [-\]: Are you a student?
CWRU2 [2d?\]: yeah- just started my 3rd year (as a grad student)
CWRU2 [2d?\]: are you?
UMichigan2 [-\]: I have a good friend in the statistics department.
UMichigan2 [-\]: I'm too old. I teach statistics.
CWRU2 [2d?\]: Ah, ok- hence the friend in the statistics department
CWRU2 [2d?\]: I'm in electrical engineering - actually a good portion of our group are engineers
UMichigan2 [-\]: She used to be here. Jiayang Sun.
UMichigan2 [-\]: Seems like a good game for an engineer.
CWRU2 [2d?\]: Hmm, I think we've had somebody from the stats dept. stop by, but it was a guy
CWRU2 [2d?\]: haha, thanks
CWRU2 [2d?\]: not too bad for statistician
UMichigan2 [-\]: Thanks for the game. Good fight.
CWRU2 [2d?\]: thank you- you too
CWRU2 [2d?\]: hopefully we'll see each other around in person some time
UMichigan2 [-\]: Could be.
CWRU2 [2d?\]: alright, take care- thanks again
UMichigan2 [-\]: Good luck in your other matches.
UMichigan2 [-\]: Bye.
