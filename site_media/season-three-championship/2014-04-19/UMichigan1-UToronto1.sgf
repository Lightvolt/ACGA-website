]
;W[mq]WL[926.726]C[zchen [?\]: They are wuite the favorite to win this year
zchen [?\]: especially since they already made it to the Finals
]
;B[mr]BL[996.633]
;W[pl]WL[901.7]C[zchen [?\]: This game started out with an interesting fight on the upper side
zchen [?\]: I'd say the fight resulting from the L16 pincer favored White
zchen [?\]: as he has secured the top territory and made the J14 string of black stones all dame
]
;B[rn]BL[915.017]
;W[qo]WL[885.427]
;B[pm]BL[909.684]
;W[om]WL[880.142]C[zchen [?\]: now, the focus of the game shifts to the right side as Black must surround a rather large amount of territory there, to catch up in territory

;B[rk]BL[902.715]C[spacetime [4d\]: o8 n7 necessary for w now?
zchen [?\]: if he succeeds in separating the Q9 stonrs from the P7 stones
zchen [?\]: while heeping his own stuff alive, he will have a big advantage
]
;W[rj]WL[812.033]C[zchen [?\]: Black can play R9, R10, Q10, P10, Q11, O8
]
;B[qk]BL[854.346]C[zchen [?\]: that would be an exchange for Black keeping territory on the right, while W gets to connect and be alive
spacetime [4d\]: P10??
]
;W[nl]WL[782.661]C[spacetime [4d\]: or atari first i guess
zchen [?\]: aha, W has done something clever, forsaking that exchange
zchen [?\]: this that R10 Q10 exchange
zchen [?\]: that helps white and is clearly better
zchen [?\]: say B plays Q11, and w P9
dogbert [4d\]: is uiuc in this league? uiuc could have a bleedy strong top board
zchen [?\]: B will have about 40 on the right, 15 on bottom, and 5 on left for 60 points
zchen [?\]: w has 15 on left bottom, 5 right bottom, 25 on top for 45
zchen [?\]: but B would have a very weak group in the middle
zchen [?\]: since it would be Black's turn, the game would be about even
zchen [?\]: and more exciting things will happen later
zchen [?\]: in the meantime
zchen [?\]: Board 4 has finished, and the game goes to
zchen [?\]: UMichigan
]
;B[oj]BL[639.83]C[dogbert [4d\]: ha, now if Michigan win 3rd and 5th board too....Toronto would be too disappointed:)
Javaness [2d\]: hope i didn't put them off

;B[pj]BL[638.053]C[zchen [?\]: Looks like Board 5 will go to Utoront
]
;W[gq]WL[379.822]C[zchen [?\]: Michigan needs to win board 3
zchen [?\]: then they have a good chance
]
;B[ep]BL[602.827]C[zchen [?\]: B chose Gote with P10+Q10
]
;W[ho]WL[373.519]C[zchen [?\]: locally it is a strong shape
]
;B[iq]BL[598.289]C[zchen [?\]: but White has invadedstrongly on the bottom
Palehorse [?\]: zchen, really good of you to give a commentary, thanks :)
zchen [?\]: this is not an invasion, 
wurst [3k\]: H5 should G5 ?
]
;W[jp]WL[329.689]C[zchen [?\]: H5 is used to make "many" exchanges
zchen [?\]: giving you many stones to settle down
zchen [?\]: H5 is offensive
wurst [3k\]: thx
]
;B[kp]BL[547.588]C[zchen [?\]: rising, and getting reasy to close the net over his opponent,
zchen [?\]: In go, it is good to 'know your place'
zchen [?\]: and here, white is not invading, and trying to destroy territory
zchen [?\]: he is pincer-attacking
zchen [?\]: like German Panzers in WW2
DineshR [3k?\]: ^ lol
]
;W[ip]WL[254.41]C[spacetime [4d\]: this commentary is amazing
Palehorse [?\]: they played go in WW2?
zchen [?\]: the state of affairs, is what prompted H5 instead of G5
UMichigan4 [-\]: the Panzers didn't have to pincer, i think
zchen [?\]: offence and defense
troll [2d\]: could b compromise here with g4?
]
;B[jq]BL[526.619]
;W[hq]WL[250.511]C[jgomo3 [8k?\]: UMIchigan1 contra UToronto1
zchen [?\]: Oh they cut Deep into enemy territory, quickly
]
;B[kn]BL[511.073]C[zchen [?\]: Aha! W can now seal off the F5 stones
troll [2d\]: why is b playing from this side, dont the f5 stones deserves some help?
zchen [?\]: with one move
zchen [?\]: leaving the right side to it's fate
bemap [1d\]: g6
Palehorse [?\]: troll, b wants to kill the right group?
zchen [?\]: or, he can protect the right side
zchen [?\]: this is where it gets good
]
;W[ll]WL[190.204]C[zchen [?\]: it's so easy and seductive, just play f6/g7/g6, it all works
]
;B[fm]BL[488.268]C[zchen [?\]: but no he goes back to defend
]
;W[hm]WL[179.018]C[zchen [?\]: now J13 stones are weak, H5 stones are weak, F7 stones are weak, O8 stones are
