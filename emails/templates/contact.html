<p>Is your college Go club interested in competing in the next season of the Collegiate Go League?</p>

<p>It's easy! Your team captain should contact us on behalf of your school's go club, with the following information:</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>The names and ranks of players on your roster.</b> KGS ranks are preferred. You can have as many players on your roster as you like, but only 5 people can represent your school in any given match. Each team member should be an active member of that school's Go club.</li>
	<li><b>A team captain, responsible for managing the team.</b> The team captain will be our contact to your club, will keep the school's roster up-to-date, and will coordinate players' login and participation during matches.</li>
	<li><b>Other club information:</b> Club president, club officer mailing list / contact email, website. </li>
</ul>

<p>We will then add your club to the website, and send you more details on how to participate.</p>
<p>If you would like to be listed in our database without participating in league play, that's fine too - just leave out the roster.</p>
</br>
<p>We're a fast-growing group, so let us know how we can improve the site, answer your questions, or serve the Go community.</p>
