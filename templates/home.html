<p><strong>Go</strong> is an <strong>ancient two-player board game</strong> based on simple rules that lead to immense strategic and aesthetic complexity. Also known as weiqi <em>(China)</em>, baduk <em>(Korea)</em>, or igo <em>(Japan)</em>, Go combines the <strong>tactical intensity of chess</strong> with <strong>abstract, global judgment</strong> to make an exceptionally challenging and rewarding game. In fact, Go is one of few remaining games where skilled human players can easily defeat the best computers. <strong>To learn how to play</strong>, take a look at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(board_game)#Overview">the basics</a>, check out our <a href="/media/"> go-playing images</a>, find a <a href="/members/#search">club near you</a>, or <a href="/contact/"> contact us</a> with your questions.</p></li>
