Hi everyone,

The next CGL round is scheduled for Saturday, {{next_round.date}} at 1pm EST/10am PST. Your team should log onto the accounts we have provided and be ready to go at 12:30pm EST in the Collegiate Go League room on KGS. If you've lost track of your login information, we can reset it for you.

The following schools are matched:

{% for match in next_round.match_set.all %}
	{{match.school1}} vs. {{match.school2}}
{% endfor %}

{% if unmatched_school %}
{{unmatched_school}} has a bye this round.

If your school cannot compete this Saturday, please let us know by Wednesday, so that we can switch in {{unmatched_school}}.

{% else %}
If your school cannot compete this Saturday, please let us know as soon as possible.
{% endif %}

Good luck to all teams.
