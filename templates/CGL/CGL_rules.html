<h1>The Rules</h1>
	<p><b>League Format:</b> There are two leagues: A league and B league. The B league differs from the A league in that handicap stones are more generous, and each team only has to field three players, instead of five. Matches occur once every other week throughout the school year, except in December and March, to avoid winter/spring breaks. A week before each round, our algorithm will randomly match together schools who have not played each other previously that season. If there are an odd number of schools, schools with the fewest forfeited games are given priority in match pairing. Seeding into the championship tournament is determined by number of wins, so a college who joins late may still be invited to the championship tournament. </p>
    <p><b>Match Format:</b> A "match" refers to a set of five (or three) games between two schools, depending on whether the schools are in the A league or B league. Each school will field 5 (3) players. The 5 (3) players from each team will play each other, sorted from strongest to weakest. The match will be won by the school who wins the majority of the 5 (3) boards. No-shows for a board are counted as forfeits.</p>
	<p><b>Team logistics:</b> Each school will nominate a team captain, who will maintain a roster of active team members. The team captain will be responsible for making sure that their team shows up on time for each match. These team members should be active members of the club. There is no limit to the number of people on a roster, although only five (or three) team members may represent a school in any given match. People are eligible to compete for a college club if they are active members of the club.</p>
	<p><b>Time:</b> Matches occur every other Saturday throughout the regular season. The starting time is currently set at 1PM EST/10AM PST, and ending by 3PM EST/noon PST. Please try to arrive in the tournament room half an hour earlier than the match start, to minimize delays. Both A and B leagues occur simultaneously.</p>
    <p><b>Location:</b> <a href="http://www.gokgs.com">KGS</a>, Room: "Collegiate Go League", under "Tournaments".</p>
    <p><b>Game settings:</b> 30m main time, 5x30second byo-yomi, Chinese Ruleset with 7.5 points komi, unrated, no undos, and handicap as specified below. A moderator will be on hand to resolve any disputes/conflicts.</p>
    <p><b>Handicap:</b> All games shall be played with one stone fewer than the normal handicap.</p>
    <p><b>No-Show:</b> If an entire school has not shown up by 1:15PM EST, that school forfeits the entire match. If at least one team member has shown up, that deadline is extended to 1:30pm EST, after which all missing boards are considered forfeits. If a school does not have all five boards present by 1:15PM EST, then it should move up all of its players to fill empty boards before starting its games. Latecomers and/or substitutes will then play the bottom boards.</p>
    <p><b>Reporting Results:</b> We will handle the uploading and tagging of games. You can help us out by remembering to state your name in-game, so that the names of the players are in the SGF file. If we can't figure out who played a game, it will be recorded as "Unknown Player".</p>
    <h4><b>Championship Tournament:</b></h4>
    <p>Each season culminates in a championship tournament, featuring the top four schools, as measured by wins, ties, and fewest losses. The championship games, like the normal season games, take place on KGS. All games will be <emph>no handicap</emph>. All other rules are the same as normal - in particular, any active members of the club may compete on the school's behalf. </p>
    <p>The championship takes place over 2 weekends in a double elimination format. The top four schools are seeded against each other (1st vs. 4th; 2nd vs. 3rd) in the first weekend. Winners pair off to determine first and second place; the losers pair off to determine third and fourth place.</p>
    <p>The winner of the championship takes home a prize trophy, which they get to keep for a year, and $250 for their club. Second and third place schools get $100 and $50, respectively.</p>
