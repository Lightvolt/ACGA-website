<h1>The Rules</h1>
	<p><b>League Format:</b> There are two leagues: A league and B league. The A league is for larger, more competitive clubs, and the B league is for smaller, more casual clubs. The A league features teams of five and a reduced handicap, while the B league has teams of three and full handicap. For both leagues, matches occur every other week throughout the school year, except in December and March, to avoid winter/spring breaks. </p>
    <p><b>Match Format:</b> A "match" refers to a set of five (or three) games between two schools, depending on whether the schools are in the A (or B) league. Each school will field 5 (3) players. The 5 (3) players from each team will play each other, sorted from strongest to weakest. The match will be won by the school who wins the majority of the 5 (3) boards. No-shows for a board are counted as losses.</p>
	<p><b>Time:</b> Matches generally occur on alternating Saturdays, and matches generally avoid finals periods and spring break. Matches start at 1PM EST/10AM PST, and are usually over by 3PM EST/noon PST. Please try to arrive in the tournament room 15 minutes earlier than the match start, to minimize delays. Both A and B leagues occur simultaneously.</p>
    <p><b>Location:</b> <a href="http://www.gokgs.com">KGS</a>, Room: "Collegiate Go League", under "Tournaments".</p>
    <p><b>Game settings:</b> 30m main time, 5x30second byo-yomi, Chinese Ruleset with 7.5 points komi, unrated, no undos, and handicap as specified below. A moderator will be on hand to resolve any disputes/conflicts.</p>
    <p><b>Handicap:</b> Games in the A league shall be played with one stone fewer than the normal handicap, up to a maximum of 5 stones. Games in the B league shall be played with full handicap, up to a maximum of 9 stones.</p>
    <p><b>No-Show (A league):</b> If a school cannot produce five players by 1:15PM EST, then it should move its players to fill in missing boards (i.e. if board 4 is missing, then board 5 should move to board 4.) The missing boards are considered forfeits. If 3/5 boards are forfeited, that is considered an unexcused absence and we will give you a warning. A second unexcused absence will result in demotion to the B league. Please double-check your time zones!</p>  
    <p><b>No-show (B league):</b> Please show up on time. It's not nice to waste your opponents' time.</p>
    <h4>Logistics</h4>
    <p><b>For the team captain:</b> Each school will nominate a team captain, who will maintain a roster of active team members on the CGL website. The team captain will be responsible for making sure that their team shows up on time for each match. These team members should be active members of the club. There is no limit to the number of people on a roster, although only five (or three) team members may represent a school in any given match. People are eligible to compete for a college club if they are active members of the club.</p>
    <p><b>For us, the CGL organizers:</b> On Wednesday at midnight, three days before the match day, our algorithm will create matchups for that Saturday's round. If you are unable to participate in that round, you must let us know before Wednesday. Schools who have not played each other previously that season are preferentially matched up. If there are an odd number of schools, schools with the fewest forfeited games are given priority in match pairing.</p>
    <p><b>After the match:</b> We will handle the reporting, uploading, and tagging of games to our website. You can help us out by remembering to state your name in-game, so that the names of the players are in the SGF file. If we can't figure out who played a game, it will be recorded as "Unknown Player".</p>
    <h4><b>Championship Tournament:</b></h4>
    <p>Each season culminates in a championship tournament. This year, the top four schools from the A league, as ranked by wins, then fewest losses, then ties, will be invited to the championship tournament. The championship games, like the normal season games, take place on KGS. All games will be <emph>no handicap</emph>. All other rules are the same as normal - in particular, any active members of the club may compete on the school's behalf. </p>
    <p>The championship takes place over 2 weekends in a double elimination format. The top four schools are seeded against each other (1st vs. 4th; 2nd vs. 3rd) in the first weekend. Winners pair off to determine first and second place; the losers pair off to determine third and fourth place.</p>
    <p>The winner of the championship takes home a prize trophy, which they get to keep for a year, and $250 for their club. Second and third place schools get $100 and $50, respectively.</p>
