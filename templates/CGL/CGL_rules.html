<h1>CGL Rules</h1>

<p>Questions can be directed to {{"cgl.tournament.director@gmail.com"|obfuscate|safe}}</p>

<p><b>League Format:</b>The CGL features teams of three, competing in matches every other week throughout the school year, except in December and March, to avoid winter/spring breaks. </p>
<p><b>Teams and Schools:</b> Schools may have up to two teams in the CGL.</p>
<p><b>Match Format:</b> A "match" refers to a set of three games between two teams. Each team will field 3 players. The 3 players from each team will play each other, pairing from strongest to weakest. The match will be won by the team who wins the majority of the 3 boards. No-shows for a board are counted as losses.</p>
<p><b>Time/Dates:</b> Matches occur every other Saturday, starting at 1PM EST/10AM PST, and usually ending by 3PM EST/noon PST. See <a href="/CGL/results/">the Leaderboard page </a> for a full schedule of matches. Please try to arrive in the tournament room 15 minutes earlier than the match start, to minimize delays.</p>
<p><b>Location:</b> <a href="http://www.gokgs.com">KGS</a>, Room: "Collegiate Go League", under "Tournaments".</p>
<p><b>Game settings:</b> 30m main time, 5x30second Japanese byo-yomi, Chinese Ruleset with 7.5 points komi, unrated, no undos, and handicap as specified below. A moderator will be on hand to resolve any disputes/conflicts.</p>
<p><b>Handicap:</b> Games in the CGL shall be played with one stone fewer than the normal handicap, up to a maximum of 5 stones. For example, a 5kyu vs 10kyu match would have a 4 stone handicap, and a 7d vs. 1d match would have a 5 stone handicap. Handicap stone placement is free, in accordance with the Ing rule philosophy.</p>
<p><b>No-Show:</b> A team with some of its members missing at 1:15 PM EST will have been considered to have forfeited those boards. Missing more than one person of course means losing the match by default. Please double-check your time zones!</p>

<h4>Logistics</h4>
<p><b>For the team captain:</b> Each school will nominate a team captain, who will maintain a roster of active team members on the CGL website. The team captain will be responsible for making sure that their team shows up on time for each match. There is no limit to the number of people on a roster. People are eligible to compete for a college club if they are <b>current students</b> at that college - undergraduate or graduate.</p>
<p><b>For us, the CGL organizers:</b> One week before the match day, we will create matchups for that Saturday's round. If you are unable to participate in that round, let us know ASAP. Schools who have not played each other previously that season are preferentially matched up. We also try to match schools of similar win/loss history. If there are an odd number of schools, schools with the fewest forfeited games are given priority in match pairing.</p>
<p> During the round itself, we will handle any issues like missing/late players and handicap/rule questions.</p>
<p><b>After the match:</b> We will handle uploading game records and updating the standings table. Afterwards, we'll ask you to edit the game records with the names of the players.</p>

<h1>OGS Individual Collegiate Go Ladder</h1>
<p><b>Ladder Format:</b> We've created an OGS individual league for the CGL, using OGS's Ladder feature. There's a <a href="https://online-go.com/group/622">OGS CGL group</a> you can join and then you can <a href="https://online-go.com/ladder/1926">compete in the 19x19 ladder</a>.</p>

<p>To play on OGS's ladder system, you'll need a rated (not provisional) account. That will take about 10 games of play before the system takes away the ?.</p>

<h1>Championship Tournament:</h1>
<p>Each season culminates in a championship tournament. The top four schools, as ranked by wins, then fewest losses, then ties, then fewest forfeited boards, will be invited to the championship tournament. The championship games, like the normal season games, take place on KGS. All games will be <emph>no handicap</emph>. All other rules are the same as normal.</p>
<p>The championship takes place over 3 weekends in single elimination format, with an additional match between the losers of the semifinals, to determine 3rd place. Seeding will work as follows: [1v8, 4v5], [3v6, 2v7].</p>
<p>The winner of the championship takes home a prize trophy, which they get to keep for a year, and $250 for their club. Second and third place schools get $100 and $50, respectively.</p>
