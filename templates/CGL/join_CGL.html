	<h2>Join the League</h2>
	<p>Is your college Go club interested in competing in the next round of the Collegiate Go League? Season Two will start on September 22nd, but even if you've missed the kickoff, you can still join in.</p>
	<p>Your club should designate a team captain, who will be responsible for managing the team. The team captain will be our contact to your club, will regularly update the school's roster, and will coordinate players' login and participation during matches.</p>
	<p>Then, submit the following information to us: </p>
	<ul>
		<li><b>The names and ranks (KGS ranks preferred) of 5 or more players.</b> You can have as many players on your roster as you like, but only 5 people may represent your school in any given match. Each team member should be an active member of that school's Go club.</li>
		<li><b>Club info:</b> Club president, club mailing list/contact info., club website, Facebook group, etc. You don't have to submit all of these -- the more, the better.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>We'll add your club to our database, and send you more details on how to participate in the next round of the CGL.  	</p>
	<p>If you would like to be listed in our database without participating in league play, that's fine too.  Send us your school's info, and we'll post it.</p>
