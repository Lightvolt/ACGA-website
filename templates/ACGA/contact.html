<p>We're a fast-growing group, and we're eager for feedback. Tell us what you're thinking, how you think we can improve the site, or how we can benefit the Go community. Or if you have any questions about what we do, ask away!</p>

<p>This page also doubles as our sign-up page for interested colleges. A team captain should contact us with name and ranks of their players, along with any club info you'd like to volunteer.</p>
<p>If you would like to be listed in our database without participating in league play, that's fine too.  Send us your school's info, and we'll post it.</p>
