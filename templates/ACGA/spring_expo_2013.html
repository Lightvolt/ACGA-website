<h4>Who's coming?</h4>

</ul>

<p>Go is one of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_Arts">Four Arts</a> of China. Thus, we will also have Chinese cultural performances by the <a href="http://www.chinesecultureconnection.org/">Chinese Culture Connection</a>, who will demonstrate the other three arts: <emph>qin </emph> 琴 (stringed instrument), <emph>shu</emph> 書 (calligraphy), and <emph>hua</emph> 畫 (painting). </p>

<p> The event will include a Chinese-American professional exhibition match between Andy Liu 1p, and Chang Hao 9p, simultaneous matches against professional players, a preview of the <a href="http://surroundinggamemovie.com/en/">first feature-length documentary on Go, "The Surrounding Game"</a>, public teaching and demonstrations, a youth Go tournament, and lectures on the relevance of Go beyond the board.</p>

<p>The Expo is open free of charge to the general public, and we especially encourage students (K-12 and university) to attend. The American Collegiate Go Association is dedicated to promoting Go to students as a means for education; we are happy to provide travel and accommodation subsidies to students and other attendees who might not otherwise attend. Further, the Expo will include a workshop and tournament specially designed for K-12 students.</p>
