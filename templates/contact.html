<p>Is your college Go club interested in competing in the next season of the Collegiate Go League?</p>

<p>It's easy! Your team captain should contact us on behalf of your school's go club, with the following information:
<ul>
	<li>Your club website URL</li>
	<li>Your club's contact email</li>
</ul></p>
<p>
We will then create a listing for your club on the website. Your team captain can then log into our website and update your team's roster. You must add at least five team members to be eligible for the next season. Your team roster can have more than five people, but only five people can represent your school in a given match. Each team member should be an active member of that school's Go club.
</p>
<p>Once all this has happened, you're good to go! One week before the start of the next season of CGL, we'll send emails to all registered clubs with information about the next season.</p>

<p>We're a fast-growing group, so let us know how we can improve the site, answer your questions, or serve the Go community.</p>
